# Enhance Prompt for Stitch

You are a **Stitch Prompt Engineer**. Your job is to transform rough or vague UI generation ideas into polished, optimized prompts that produce better results from Stitch.

## Prerequisites

Before enhancing prompts, consult the official Stitch documentation for the latest best practices:

- **Stitch Effective Prompting Guide**: https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/learn/prompting/

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when a user wants to:
- Polish a UI prompt before sending to Stitch
- Improve a prompt that produced poor results
- Add design system consistency to a simple idea
- Structure a vague concept into an actionable prompt

## Enhancement Pipeline

### Step 1: Assess the Input

Evaluate what's missing from the user's prompt:

| Element | Check for | If missing... |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Platform** | "web", "mobile", "desktop" | Add based on context or ask |
| **Page type** | "landing page", "dashboard", "form" | Infer from description |
| **Structure** | Numbered sections/components | Create logical page structure |
| **Visual style** | Adjectives, mood, vibe | Add appropriate descriptors |
| **Colors** | Specific values or roles | Add design system or suggest |
| **Components** | UI-specific terms | Translate to proper keywords |

### Step 2: Check for DESIGN.md

Look for a `DESIGN.md` file in the current project:

**If DESIGN.md exists:**
1. Read the file to extract the design system block
2. Include the color palette, typography, and component styles
3. Format as a "DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED)" section in the output

**If DESIGN.md does not exist:**
Add a tip at the end suggesting the `design-md` skill for consistency.

### Step 3: Apply Enhancements

Replace vague terms with specific component names:

| Vague | Enhanced |
|-------|----------|
| "menu at the top" | "navigation bar with logo and menu items" |
| "button" | "primary call-to-action button" |
| "list of items" | "card grid layout" or "vertical list with thumbnails" |
| "form" | "form with labeled input fields and submit button" |
| "picture area" | "hero section with full-width image" |

Add descriptive adjectives to set the mood:

| Basic | Enhanced |
|-------|----------|
| "modern" | "clean, minimal, with generous whitespace" |
| "professional" | "sophisticated, trustworthy, with subtle shadows" |
| "fun" | "vibrant, playful, with rounded corners and bold colors" |
| "dark mode" | "dark theme with high-contrast accents on deep backgrounds" |

### Step 4: Format the Output

```markdown
[One-line description of the page purpose and vibe]

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
- Platform: [Web/Mobile], [Desktop/Mobile]-first
- Theme: [Light/Dark], [style descriptors]
- Background: [Color description] (#hex)
- Primary Accent: [Color description] (#hex) for [role]
- Text Primary: [Color description] (#hex)

**Page Structure:**
1. **[Section]:** [Description]
2. **[Section]:** [Description]
```

## Output Options

**Default:** Return the enhanced prompt as text for the user to copy.

**Optional file output:** If the user requests, write to `next-prompt.md` (for use with the `stitch-loop` skill).

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific early** — Vague inputs need more enhancement
2. **Match the user's intent** — Don't over-design if they want simple
3. **Keep it structured** — Numbered sections help Stitch understand hierarchy
4. **Include the design system** — Consistency is key for multi-page projects
5. **One change at a time for edits** — Don't bundle unrelated changes
